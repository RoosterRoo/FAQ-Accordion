## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build this website. Used the mobile-first approach to build
the responsive design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had some issues with the background svg initially and had to search for a solution. Hoping to get
additional pointers from other learners on how to improve the layout.

### Continued development

Need to animate the accordion button. For now, it is static and the image is being replaced on
interacting with the button.

Will reach out to other learners, designers, developers, users for further feedback on what and how to
improve the layout.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.php) - This helped me for the content to overflow into the background image.
- [Hubspot blog](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html-line-break) - Initially thought of adding line breaks to get the panel content to break into different lines and found this amazing article on the do's and don'ts of the "br" tag.
